This repository contains files for a School Management System web application. It includes initial commits for CSS styles (css/, css2/), JavaScript (js/), web fonts (webfonts/), and an admin panel (admin/). The index.php file serves as the main entry point, and schoolmanagement.sql provides the SQL database schema for setting up the system.

Features:
Admin Panel: Includes initial setup for managing school data.
CSS and JS: Basic styling and front-end functionality.
Database Schema: schoolmanagement.sql defines the database structure.
Feel free to explore and utilize these files to develop or enhance your own School Management System.
